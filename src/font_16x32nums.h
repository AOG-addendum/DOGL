/* File '16X32_numbers.FV' as include
The font was generated with EA FontEditor. Please contact ELECTRONIC ASSEMBLY
for more details (techik@lcd-module.de)

 the array starts with a 8 uint8_t header:
  1st uint8_t: 'F' first 2 uint8_ts are always FV
  2nd uint8_t: 'V' for FONT VERTICAL
  3rd uint8_t: First code to define
  4th uint8_t: Last  code to define
  5th uint8_t: Width of character in dots
  6th uint8_t: Height of character in dots
  7th uint8_t: Height of character in uint8_ts
  8th uint8_t: uint8_ts needed for each character (1..255)
            or 0 for big fonts calculate WidthInDots * HeightInuint8_ts
  After that font data will follow */
